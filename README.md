# 🚗 Impact of Car Features on Price and Profitability

## 🧠 Overview
This project analyzes the relationship between car features, pricing, and profitability to help car manufacturers make informed decisions. By using statistical techniques like regression analysis and data visualization in Tableau, the project identifies the most popular and profitable features, and how different variables influence a car's MSRP.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze how car features affect price and profit
- Explore market categories and brand impact
- Use data to recommend pricing and development strategies
- Visualize car feature relationships with Tableau dashboards

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- **Microsoft Excel 2021**
- **Tableau Public**

## 🗂 Project Tasks & Insights

### 🔹 Task 1: Popularity of Car Models by Market Category
- Created pivot tables and combo charts to show top 25 popular market categories.
- Insight: Some categories appear popular due to a few well-known models.

### 🔹 Task 2: Engine Power vs Price
- Scatter chart and trendline show a **positive correlation** — more engine power leads to higher prices.

### 🔹 Task 3: Key Features Affecting Car Price
- Regression analysis reveals top influencing features:
  - **Engine Cylinders** and **All-Wheel Drive** ➡️ Strong positive impact
  - **Front-Wheel Drive** ➡️ Strong negative impact

### 🔹 Task 4: Manufacturer-wise Average Price
- Bugatti leads with ~$2M MSRP.
- Insight: Brand positioning heavily influences pricing.

### 🔹 Task 5: Fuel Efficiency vs Engine Cylinders
- Negative correlation (`-0.59`) indicates higher cylinders = lower MPG.
